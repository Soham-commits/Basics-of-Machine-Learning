ðŸ“˜ Basics of Machine Learning

Welcome to the Basics of Machine Learning project!
This repository is a beginner-friendly collection of foundational machine learning concepts, code examples, and hands-on projects designed to help you learn and understand ML step by step.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project is to learn by doing. It covers essential machine learning topics and provides working code for each concept so you can:
	â€¢	Understand how ML algorithms work
	â€¢	Practice implementing models from scratch and using libraries
	â€¢	Build confidence in applying ML to real-world datasets

	â€¢	ðŸ”¢ Data Preprocessing (Cleaning, Scaling, Encoding)
	â€¢	ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	â€¢	ðŸ“ˆ Supervised Learning
	â€¢	Linear Regression
	â€¢	Logistic Regression
	â€¢	Decision Trees
	â€¢	k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
	â€¢	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
	â€¢	ðŸ§  Unsupervised Learning
	â€¢	K-Means Clustering
	â€¢	PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
	â€¢	ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation
	â€¢	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
	â€¢	Confusion Matrix
	â€¢	Cross-Validation
